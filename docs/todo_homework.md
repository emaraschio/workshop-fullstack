## Homework

Just to get some more practice around those concepts, I challenge you to make this homework:

1. Create a sample html page
1. Create a docker container to run the page
3. Push the container to Docker Hub
4. Create an AWS Cluster and run the container


Hint: On this folder you will see some more documentation to get this done, good luck!
